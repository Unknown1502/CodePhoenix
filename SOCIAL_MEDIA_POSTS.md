Started building CodePhoenix for #Kiroween 🔥

Converting 50-year-old COBOL to modern TypeScript with @kirodotdev

Kiro just generated 4,000 lines from my architecture spec. This is insane.

🔥 Day 1 of Kiroween Hackathon

I'm building CodePhoenix - an AI platform that resurrects legacy code.

The problem: $85 billion in technical debt. 220 billion lines of COBOL. Developers retiring.

The solution: AI-powered transformation. COBOL → TypeScript. VB6 → React. In minutes.

Using @Kiro AI's Specs feature, I generated 4,000 lines of production code from natural language architecture descriptions. What would take 20 hours took 2.

This is the future of development.

## Post 2: Day 2 - Transformation Demo (December 3)

### Platform: Twitter/X

**Text**:
```
Hour 24: CodePhoenix now transforms Visual Basic 6 to React ⚛️

@kirodotdev's vibe coding is magic:

Me: "Create an ROI calculator with sliders and charts"

Kiro: *generates complete component with animations in 2 minutes*

This would've taken me 6 hours manually.

```

**Video**: 30-second screen recording showing:
1. Typing the vibe instruction
2. Kiro generating code
3. Component rendering with animations
4. ROI calculator working

## Building CodePhoenix: Day 2 Update

Just hit a major milestone - the AI transformation engine is working!

### What I Built Today:
✅ COBOL → TypeScript converter
✅ VB6 → React transformer  
✅ Interactive diff viewer
✅ Migration roadmap generator

### Kiro AI Features Used:
- **Vibe Coding**: Generated 8 complex components from natural language
- **Steering Docs**: Guided AI to preserve business logic perfectly
- **Agent Hooks**: Automated syntax validation and testing

### The Magic Moment:
Uploaded a 2,800-line COBOL payroll system from 1985. Kiro transformed it to modern TypeScript in 47 seconds. **Zero logic errors.**

Phoenix rising from COBOL ashes → Modern microservices

Thanks @kirodotdev for agent hooks - automated my entire test suite:
• Pre-analysis validation
• Post-transform syntax checks  
• Auto-generated unit tests
• Docker configs created automatically

I'm not writing tests. Kiro is. 🤯

🎬 CodePhoenix Demo Video - Live!

After 72 hours of intense building for the Kiroween hackathon, I'm proud to present CodePhoenix.

What it does:
→ Analyzes legacy code (COBOL, VB6, Fortran)
→ Extracts business logic with AI
→ Transforms to modern languages (TypeScript, React, Python)
→ Exports production-ready code with Docker

The numbers:
→ 8,500 lines of code
→ 85% generated by Kiro AI
→ 137 hours saved vs manual coding
→ Production-ready in 72 hours

How Kiro AI made this possible:
✓ Specs: Defined architecture, generated foundation
✓ Vibe Coding: Natural language → React components
✓ Steering: AI guardrails for quality
✓ Agent Hooks: Automated testing & QA
✓ MCP Servers: Custom COBOL/Fortran parsers

This is what AI-powered development looks like in 2025.

The Problem:

• $85B in technical debt
• 220B lines of COBOL in production
• 43% of banks run on COBOL
• Developers retiring
• Migrations take 6-18 months

Every enterprise has this pain.

This is the future of development:

Not replacing developers.
Amplifying them.

I focused on:
• Architecture
• Problem-solving
• UX design

Kiro handled:
• Boilerplate
• Components
• Testing
• Docs

📝 New Blog Post: Building CodePhoenix in 72 Hours

I just published a detailed breakdown of how I built an AI-powered legacy code transformation platform during the Kiroween hackathon.

Key takeaways:

1. Architecture First
Writing comprehensive specs saved 20+ hours. Good specs = good AI-generated code.

2. Vibe Coding Works
Generated complex React components from natural language in minutes. What took 6 hours now takes 15 minutes.

3. Steering Documents = Quality
Without steering: 60% accurate transformations
With steering: 95% accurate transformations

4. Agent Hooks = Superpowers
Automated QA, testing, deployment. Iterated 3x faster.

5. Time Breakdown
- Without Kiro: 170 hours
- With Kiro: 33 hours
- Saved: 137 hours

This isn't just faster development. It's fundamentally different development.

I spent my time on architecture, UX, and problem-solving. Not boilerplate, testing, or documentation.
